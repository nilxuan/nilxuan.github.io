Do you think you are going no where in life?

Stop!

Take a deep breathe!

Think!

New York is three hours ahead of California, but that does not make California slow.

Cameroon is six hours ahead of New York but it does not make New York slow.

Someone graduated from collage at 22 but wait for five years before securing a job.

Someone became a CEO at 25 but died at 50.

Someone became a CEO at 50 but lived to 90 years.

Someone is still single, while another is married with children.

Absolutely, everyone in this world works based on their own time zone.

People around you might seem to be ahead of you.

That total fine, some are behind you.

Everyone is running their own race in their own time zone.

Don't envy or mock them.

They are in their own time zone and you are in yours.

Life is about waiting for the right moment to react.

So relax.

You're not late.

You're not early.

You're very much on time, and in your time zone.

Everyone have a different exams paper meaning different questions.

Everyone have a different assignment meaning different purpose in life.

So focus on your own exam paper, your assignment and purpose.

Don't copy and paste or steal answer else you will fail big time.

Be like the hummingbird. 

Event when mighty lions and tigers underestimated him, he continued to do what he could, where he was, just as he was, with the little he had.

You're ok just the way you are. The little work you are doing today might seem insignificant but I bet someday you will see the big picture.

You're not late, you're not early.
